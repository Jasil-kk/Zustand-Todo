# Task Management

## State Management with Zustand

This project utilizes [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) for state management, offering a minimalistic and effective way to handle application state. Zustand is chosen for its simplicity and ease of integration compared to more complex state management solutions like Redux.

### Why Zustand?

- **Minimal Boilerplate**: Zustand requires minimal setup and boilerplate, making it easy to integrate.
- **Reactivity**: Zustand's store automatically triggers re-renders in your components when the state changes.
- **Persistence**: Zustand supports state persistence with both `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`.

### Installation

To install Zustand, run:

```bash
npm install zustand
```
